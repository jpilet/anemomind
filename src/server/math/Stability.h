 * This function is used to identify jointly stable
 * segments of data when having several signals.
 * For instance, when building a target speed table,
 * we have TWA, TWS and boat speed as the three signals.
 * Call them Y0, Y1, Y2 respectively. They are all indexed
 * by a common time X. In that case, we will pass
 * as xyPairs = ((X, Y0), (X, Y1), (X, Y2))
 * The optimize function will then proceed by simplifying
 * each signal by approximating it using piecewise constant
 * values. These simplifications are used to determine how
 * locally stable a signal is. Finally, a vector valued signal
 * is returned, that is also piecewise constant and where
 * each constant segment has a stability. Those segments
 * can be used as input to build a target speed table.
