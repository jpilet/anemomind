/*
 * Solves a least squares problem with sparsity constraints.
 *
 * The matrix A has as many rows as the dimension of vector B.
 * So every row of A has a corresponding element in B.
 *
 * Every constraint group is a set of row spans of A and B among which activeCount
 * of them should be enforced as equality constraints. The remaining ones, that are passive,
 * neither constrain anything or affect the objective function. The set of contraints that
 * are active is optimized.
 *
 * Let A. and B. be the matrices formed by rows from A and B that are not part of
 * any constraint. This algorithm will minimize |A. X - B.|^2 subject to choosing
 * activeCount constraints from every constraint group.
 *
 * Applications: Sparsity constrained regularization, outlier detection, etc.
 *
 * To see an example, look at SparsityConstrainedTest.cpp and set the visualize flag to true.
