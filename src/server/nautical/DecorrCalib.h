 * Calibration by assuming that wind and current are locally decorrelated.
 * This is reasonable. A sudden change in the wind is likely not to affect the current,
 * because the current has so much inertia. For longer time spans of several hours,
 * this decorrelation assumption may be less true.
 *
 * How it works:
 * The correlation between the actual wind and a corrupted current is close to 0. The
 * correlation between the actual current and a corrupted wind is also close to 0. This
 * is what we minimize over many short overlapping time windows.
