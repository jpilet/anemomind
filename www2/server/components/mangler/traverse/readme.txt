Unfortunately the latest version of the js-traverse library
is not on npm yet, so I put the source code here. We need
the latest version.

I am referring to the fork of js-traverse which is found here:

https://github.com/jankuca/js-traverse

and the index.js file is this one:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jankuca/js-traverse/master/index.js
