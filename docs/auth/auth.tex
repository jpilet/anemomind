\title{Anemomind Authentication API}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
The part of the software that runs on the server exhibits
an HTTP REST API at \texttt{www.anemolab.com}. To access certain resources
on the server, authentication is required. For this purpose, token-based
authentication is employed.

Token-based authentication can be summarized as follows. When a user who is registered at \texttt{anemolab.com} needs to access a resource on the server, he will need a token. A token is a piece of data that the client, e.g. the web browser, receives from the server when the user logs in. Every time the client needs to request data from the server or modify data, it will send an HTTP request to the server that contains the token. When the server receives the request from the client, it will check that the token provided is one that has been emitted from the server.

The server is implemented in \texttt{node.js} and uses the library \texttt{jwt-simple} to manage tokens. When a registered user requests a token, this request will usually be handled by \texttt{server/auth/local/index.js} which will generate a token for that user by encrypting the user account id using the \texttt{signToken} function located in \texttt{server/auth/auth.service.js}. Then token is returned as a JSON object:
\begin{verbatim}
var token = auth.signToken(user._id, user.role);
res.json({token: token});
\end{verbatim}
Once a registered user has obtained a token, this token will be attached by the client to every subsequent HTTP request made by the client, until the token expires and a new token has to be acquired. Take a look at \texttt{server/api/user/index.js}. This file exhibits an API to access and modify information related to a user. However, in order to protect information related to a user, middlewares from the \texttt{auth} service are inserted before the resource can be accessed. This middleware is defined in \texttt{server/auth/auth.service.js}. A function here is \texttt{isAuthenticated}, which creates a middleware that controls whether or not a token provided in the HTTP request is a valid one.

\begin{verbatim}
if(req.query && req.query.hasOwnProperty('access_token')) {
  req.headers.authorization = 'Bearer ' + req.query.access_token;
}
validateJwt(req, res, next);
\end{verbatim}
In the following sections, we demonstrate how this API can be practically consumed by a client.
\section{Registering a test user}
For testing purposes, we register a new user on the webpage, at \texttt{www.anemolab.com/signup}.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{signup.png}
\end{center}

In this example, the name is \texttt{authdemo}, the e-mail \texttt{authdemo@email.com} and the password \texttt{kalle123}.
\section{Obtaining a token}
Using the registered test user we can obtain a token. To demonstrate how this works in detail, we will be using cURL\footnote{http://curl.haxx.se/}. We request a new token by making this cURL call from the terminal:
\begin{verbatim}
curl -d "{\"email\":\"authdemo@email.com\",
          \"password\":\"kalle123\"}" 
     -H "Content-type: application/json" 
     http://www.anemolab.com/auth/local
\end{verbatim}
and we receive as a response
\begin{verbatim}
{"token":
"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI1
NGVkOTkzNTdkNTY3NTgzMTgzMjBlYzUiLCJpYXQiOjE0MjQ4N
TkyMzc1OTEsImV4cCI6MTQyNDg3NzIzNzU5MX0.Qmauv_nK7J
UMr8pg-OT8pUUAtIYlJxCgvyO5W0i9AEk"}
\end{verbatim}
The above token is valid at the time of writing this document but probably not at the time when you are reading it. You should therefore reproduce these experiments yourself.

A couple of things to note:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{-d} flag with its associated data string means that cURL will produce a \texttt{POST} request.
\item The data string passed to \texttt{-d} is encoded as JSON data.
\item The \texttt{-H} flag and its associated data string tells the server that JSON data is passed.
\end{itemize}
\section{Accessing data that requires authentication}
Using the token that we just obtained, we send a \texttt{GET} request to look up information about this user:
\begin{verbatim}
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ
faWQiOiI1NGVkOTkzNTdkNTY3NTgzMTgzMjBlYzU
iLCJpYXQiOjE0MjQ4NTkyMzc1OTEsImV4cCI6MTQ
yNDg3NzIzNzU5MX0.Qmauv_nK7JUMr8pg-OT8pUU
AtIYlJxCgvyO5W0i9AEk" 
http://anemolab.com/api/users/me
\end{verbatim}
and receive a response
\begin{verbatim}
{"_id":"54ed99357d56758318320ec5",
 "provider":"local",
 "name":"authdemo",
 "email":"authdemo@email.com",
 "__v":0,
 "role":"user"}
\end{verbatim}
To verify that it does not work without a valid token, we replace the token string by the string \texttt{CORRUPTED}:
\begin{verbatim}
curl -H "Authorization: CORRUPTED" http://anemolab.com/api/users/me
\end{verbatim}
and we receive the response
\begin{verbatim}
Unauthorized
\end{verbatim}
By passing the \texttt{-I} flag to the previous command, we obtain more information, among other things the status code 401.
\begin{verbatim}
