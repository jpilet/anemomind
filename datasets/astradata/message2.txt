Hi guys!

In the file  log1Hz20180215_0957_Charts.log, there is:
 'GWD' ie "Ground Wind Direction" in degrees from 0 to 360. (0 North, 90 East, 180 South, 270 West);
 'GWS' ie "Ground WInd Speed" in knots;
 'TWD' ie "True Wind Direction" in degrees like GWD;
 'TWS' ie "True Wind Speed" in knots, like GWS;
 'Lat' and 'Lon' ie "Latitude" and "Longitude" is something like degrees with decimals:
      4533.0557N means 45° 33.0557' or 45° 33' and 3'' (= 0.0557 x 60) 

 In the file Device___15___2018-03-02.log, there is (only for the moment, cause we are developing it):
  'COG' in radians (but it will be in degrees like GWD and TWD); 
  'SOG' in m/s (but it will be in knots);
  'LAT' and 'LON' is like google maps format, so decimals of degrees (but it will be as explained just before
